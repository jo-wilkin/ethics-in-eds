# Ethics in Environmental Data Science: A Toolkit

*This toolkit has been created as part of the Environmental Data Science Summit hosted by the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara, February 2023. We thank NCEAS and NSF for their support in the summit!*

### Why are we creating this toolkit?

* Data ethics (encompassing wide range of activities: data collection, community relationships, collaboration logistics; all phases of the data life cycle) are not prioritized/incentivized

* We lack consistent training/guidance in academic, non-profit, and governmental organizations

* There is a lack of clarity in taking general first principles to operational actions in the context of project specific needs.

### What will this tookit contain?

We acknowledge that one solution will not work for all - we need a suite of solutions and resources that people can choose from to customize to their needs.

Below, we provide an initial list of links of data ethics resources that we, as a community, have used in our own research or teaching projects.

Note that for EDS, we need to expand beyond the “people focus” and more into “environmental data science” focus
Add collaborative/governance guidance? Who has the power to stop/direct the project and how?

#### Deliverable framework
In order to identify/agree on general principles, it is sometimes important to give operational examples of those principles in action. This motivates us to consider theory to practice in the following framing.
