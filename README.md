# Ethics in Environmental Data Science: A Toolkit

*This toolkit has been created as part of the Environmental Data Science Summit hosted by the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara, February 2023. We thank NCEAS and NSF for their support in the summit!*

## Why are we creating this toolkit?

* Data ethics (encompassing wide range of activities: data collection, community relationships, collaboration logistics; all phases of the data life cycle) are not prioritized/incentivized when conducting data science projects;

* We lack consistent training/guidance in academic, non-profit, and governmental organizations for all stages of researchers;

* There is a lack of clarity in taking general first principles to operational actions in the context of project specific needs.

There is a need to provide researchers and collaborators with an easy to follow process to understand ethics in environmental data science projects.


## What will this tookit contain?

We acknowledge that one solution will not work for all - we need a suite of solutions and resources that people can choose from to customize to their needs.

Below is the first step of our toolkit: we provide an initial list of links of data ethics resources that we, as a community, have used in our own research or teaching projects.

Our next steps (as of February 2023) is to curate these links into an easy-to-follow workflow.

## Data Ethics Resources

In order to identify/agree on general principles, it is sometimes important to give operational examples of those principles in action. 
This motivates us to consider theory to practice in the following framing.

### General

* FAIR principles https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/ 

* Principles of Environmental Justice / Environmental Justice Principles (ejnet.org)

* CARE Principles — Global Indigenous Data Alliance (gida-global.org & https://www.gida-global.org/care )

* Racial Equity Toolkit: An Opportunity to Operationalize Equity, Government Alliance on Race and Equity (racialequityalliance.org)

* Racial Equity, California State Water Resources Control Board

* Racial Equity Information and Resources, California State Water Resources Control Board

* Racial Equity Action Plan 2023-2025 (ca.gov)
