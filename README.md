# Ethics in Environmental Data Science: A Toolkit For Graduates?

*This toolkit has been created as part of the Environmental Data Science Summit hosted by the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara, February 2023.

### Why are we creating this toolkit?

*Data ethics (encompassing wide range of activities: data collection, community relationships, collaboration logistics; all phases of the data life cycle) are not prioritized/incentivized in research. 
*Lack of consistent training/guidance at graduate level.

*We want to promote/advance/support/implement ethical data practices, but many of us donâ€™t have the knowledge/resources/support to start. How do we acknowledge and accept where we are and take immediate actions to help us get to where we want to go?
